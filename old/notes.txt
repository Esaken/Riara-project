For an ecommerce website, the database should at least include:

A table for products, which should have fields such as product ID, name, description, price, and image URL.
A table for customers, which should have fields such as customer ID, name, email, and address.
A table for orders, which should have fields such as order ID, customer ID, order date, and order total.
A table for order items, which should have fields such as order item ID, order ID, product ID, and quantity.
A table for categories, which should have fields such as category ID, name and a foreign key to link products to categories.
Create the database and tables using SQL commands or a tool such as phpMyAdmin.

Populate the database with sample data for testing and development.

Set up database access controls to ensure that only authorized users can access and make changes to the database.

Test the database and make sure it's working as expected.

Optimize the database for performance by adding indexing, partitioning and denormalizing as necessary.
