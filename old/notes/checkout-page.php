Create a PHP script that handles the form submission and places the order in the database.

<?php
if(isset($_POST['submit'])){
    $name = $_POST['name'];
    $address = $_POST['address'];
    $email = $_POST['email'];
    $shipping = $_POST['shipping'];
    $total = $_POST['total'];

    $connection = mysqli_connect("hostname","username","password","database_name");
    $query = "INSERT INTO orders (name, address, email, shipping, total) VALUES ('$name', '$address', '$email', '$shipping', '$total')";
    $result = mysqli_query($connection, $query);

    if($result){
        // Clear the cart and redirect to a thank you page
        unset($_SESSION['cart']);
        header("Location: thank_you.php");
    } else {
        echo "Error placing order. Please try again.";
        }
        }
        ?>
This is a basic example and it is important to consider the security of the pages, such as by implementing encryption for sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, and by sanitizing inputs, and escaping outputs. Additionally, it's important to consider scalability and maintainability of the database. It's also important to note that this example does not include payment gateway integration which is a crucial step to complete the checkout process.
