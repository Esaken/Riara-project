The above code creates a basic HTML table that displays the current products in the database. It uses PHP to connect to the database, retrieve all products, and display them in the table. The table also includes links for editing and deleting each product.

The edit-product.php and delete-product.php are separate PHP files that handle the editing and deleting of products respectively. Here is an example of how the edit-product.php file could look like:

<?php
  // Get the product id from the URL
  $id = $_GET['id'];

  // Connect to the database
  $conn = mysqli_connect("host", "username", "password", "dbname");

  // Retrieve the product details from the database
  $query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = $id";
  $result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
  $product = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);

  // Check if the form has been submitted
  if(

    <?php
    // Get the product id from the URL
    $id = $_GET['id'];
  
    // Connect to the database
    $conn = mysqli_connect("host", "username", "password", "dbname");
  
    // Retrieve the product details from the database
    $query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = $id";
    $result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);
    $product = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);
  
    // Check if the form has been submitted
    if(isset($_POST['submit'])) {
      // Update the product in the database
      $name = $_POST['name'];
      $price = $_POST['price'];
      $query = "UPDATE products SET name = '$name', price = '$price' WHERE id = $id";
      mysqli_query($conn, $query);
  
      // Redirect back to the admin dashboard
      header("Location: index.php");
    }
  ?>

<!--When deleting a product from a database, there are a few considerations to keep in mind in order to ensure that the deletion is done safely and correctly. Some examples of validation and error handling that could be added to the delete-product.php file include:

Input validation: Verify that the product ID passed in the URL is a valid integer, and that it exists in the database.
Confirmation: Prompt the user to confirm the deletion before proceeding, to prevent accidental deletions.
Error handling: Check for and handle any errors that occur when connecting to the database or deleting the product. For example, if the product doesnt exist in the database, display an error message to the user.
Logging: Keep a log of all product deletions, including the product ID, the user who deleted it, and the date and time of the deletion.
//Security: Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
//Authorization: limit the deletion action to authorized users only by adding a login system and check for user permissions before proceeding with the deletion.
//By implementing these kind of validations and error handling, it will add an extra layer of protection to your application and make it more 

//Sure, here are a few examples of SQL reports that could be produced for an ecommerce website: 

    Sales by category:

    SELECT category, SUM(price) as sales
FROM products
JOIN orders ON products.id = orders.product_id
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY sales DESC;


//This report groups sales by category and shows the total sales for each category. It joins the products and orders tables to get the category and price information and uses the SUM() function to calculate the total sales for each category

SELECT name, SUM(quantity) as units_sold
FROM products
JOIN orders ON products.id = orders.product_id
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY units_sold DESC
LIMIT 10;


//This report shows the top 10 selling products by the quantity of units sold. It joins the products and orders tables to get the product name and quantity information and uses the SUM() function to calculate the total units sold for each product.

SELECT customers.name, products.name, orders.quantity, orders.price
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id
JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.id;


//I apologize for the incomplete response. This report shows the purchase history of all customers, including the customer's name, the product name, quantity, and price of the order. It joins the customers, orders, and products tables to get the customer's name, product name, and order details.

SELECT name, SUM(quantity) as stock_levels
FROM products
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY stock_levels DESC;


//This report shows the current stock levels of all products in the inventory, including the product name and quantity available. It uses the SUM() function to calculate the total quantity of each product and groups them by product name.
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY status;


//Revenue by month:
//This report shows the revenue generated by month, it groups the orders by month and uses the SUM() function to calculate the total revenue generated for each month. The DATE_FORMAT function is used to format the date into the desired format.
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(created_at, '%Y-%m') as month, SUM(price) as revenue
FROM orders
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;

// /Average Order Value:
SELECT AVG(price) as 'average_order_value'
FROM orders;
//This report shows the average value of all the orders. It uses the AVG() function to calculate the average order value.






//Customer Acquisition:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as 'customers_acquired'
FROM orders
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-12-31';
//This report shows the number of customers acquired in a specific period of time, it uses the COUNT() function with the DISTINCT keyword to count the unique customer ids in the orders table and a WHERE clause to filter by a specific date range.
